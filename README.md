# TFC-Metric
TFC Metric is an addon to 1.7.10 TerraFirmaCraft that converts food weight units from ounces (imperial) to grams (metric).

# How it works
In base TFC, a max size piece of food is 160.0 oz. This mod does not convert this weight to grams, as 160.0 oz in grams is roughly 4535.92 g (a gross number). This addon redefines a max size piece of food as 1000.0 g. This makes it easy to split food in half (500.0 g), quarters (250.0 g), eighths (125.0 g), sixteenths (62.5 g) and so forth.
